# Multiple-Change-Points-Detection-Assuming-Power-Law-Process-in-the-Recurrent-Event-Context
Here is the code of paper "Multiple Change-Points Detection Assuming Power-Law Process in the Recurrent-Event Context". The data is generated by the matlab code and the simulation is done by R code.
The data folder contains the data of coal_data. The simulation data is generated by the Matlab code and the data set is too large to put it on the github.
